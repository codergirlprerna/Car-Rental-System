# Car-Rental-System


## Overview
This is a simple **Car Rental System** implemented in Java, which allows customers to rent and return cars. The system keeps track of available cars, customers, and rentals.

## Features
1. **Add Cars to the System**  
   - Stores details like car ID, brand, model, base rental price, and availability status.

2. **Rent a Car**  
   - Customers can rent an available car for a specific number of days.
   - The total rental price is calculated based on the number of days.
   - Once rented, the car is marked as unavailable.

3. **Return a Car**  
   - Customers can return a rented car.
   - The car is marked as available again.
   - The rental record is removed.

4. **Simple CLI-Based Menu**  
   - Users can interact via a command-line menu to rent or return cars.

## Code Explanation

### **Car Class**
- Represents a car with attributes:
  - `carId`: Unique identifier for the car.
  - `brand`: Car brand (e.g., Toyota, Honda).
  - `model`: Car model.
  - `basePricePerDay`: Daily rental cost.
  - `isAvailable`: Availability status of the car.
- Methods:
  - `calculatePrice(int days)`: Computes rental price.
  - `rent()`: Marks the car as rented.
  - `returnCar()`: Marks the car as available.

### **Customer Class**
- Represents a customer with:
  - `customerId`: Unique customer identifier.
  - `name`: Customer's name.

### **Rental Class**
- Represents a rental transaction:
  - `car`: The rented car.
  - `customer`: The customer who rented the car.
  - `days`: Number of days for the rental.

### **CarRentalSystem Class**
- Manages the car rental operations.
- Attributes:
  - `cars`: List of available cars.
  - `customers`: List of registered customers.
  - `rentals`: List of ongoing rentals.
- Methods:
  - `addCar(Car car)`: Adds a new car to the system.
  - `addCustomer(Customer customer)`: Registers a new customer.
  - `rentCar(Car car, Customer customer, int days)`: Rents a car if available.
  - `returnCar(Car car)`: Returns a rented car.

### **Menu System (CLI)**
- Allows users to:
  1. **Rent a Car**: Displays available cars, takes customer input, and processes the rental.
  2. **Return a Car**: Allows a customer to return a car.
  3. **Exit**: Ends the program.

### **Main Class**
- Creates instances of `CarRentalSystem`, adds sample cars, and initiates the CLI menu.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Compile the Java Files**
   ```

   ```
2. **Run the Program**
   ```
   java CarRentalSystem
   ```
3. **Follow the On-Screen Menu** to rent or return cars.

## Issues & Fixes
### **Bugs in the Given Code**
- `menu()` is outside the `CarRentalSystem` class.
- `Car SelectedCar` should be `Car selectedCar`.
- `System.out.println("Total Price: $%.2f%n", totalPrice);` should be formatted using `String.format()`.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a database for persistent storage.
- Add user authentication.
- Introduce different pricing models.

This **Car Rental System** serves as a great starting point for learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
